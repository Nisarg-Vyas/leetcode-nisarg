# Contributing / Personal Guidelines

- One folder per topic.
- File name: `kebab_case_problem_name.cpp`
- Keep **both** Brute & Optimized implementations if possible.
- Add short comments at the top (problem, link, idea, complexity).
- Update README problem table after every submission.
- Use conventional commits: `feat(topic): ...`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`.

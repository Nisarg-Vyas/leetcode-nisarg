# 🚀 LeetCode Progress Tracker

This repository documents my LeetCode journey — problem by problem.

## 🎯 Goals
1. Track progress and document solutions
2. Revise key patterns and concepts
3. Practice Git & GitHub
4. Follow Striver’s A2Z DSA Course

## 📁 Structure
| Folder | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| `templates` | Base code template |
| `striverA2Zdsa` | Problems from Striver’s A2Z DSA course |
| `topics` | Problems by topic (e.g., Arrays, Strings) |
| `notes` | General conceptual notes |
| `progress.md` | Weekly log of progress |
| `readme.md` | Explaination of this repo |


## 🧠 Learning Style
For each problem:
- Start with brute force
- Optimize step-by-step
- Add brute force in the same file after figuring it out
- Write short notes about key insights in the notes folder for revision
- notes will have different files, each consisting of my new learnings per week
